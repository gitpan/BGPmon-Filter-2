BGPmon-Filter version 2.0
========================

BGPmon-Filter is a collection of Perl functions that
are useful for parsing and organizing BGPmon XML messages.

- Filter.pm allows one to easily discover if a BGP message contains
  IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes, addresses, or autonymous system numbers 
  of interest.

- bgpmon-filter is an all-inclusive program that connects to a
  BGPmon instance and extracts messages detailing changes to
  IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes, addresses, or autonymous system numbers.

This filter should allow the rapid creation of clients that make 
use of the BGPmon data.
